		<h1>The Indefinite Article</h1>
		<p>The indefinite article takes two forms.It’s the word a<i>when it precedes a word that begins</i>with a consonant.It’s the word an when it precedes a word that begins with a vowel.The indefinite articleindicates that a noun refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing.For example,you might ask your friend,<b>“Should I bring a gift to the party?”</b>.Your friend will understand that you are not asking about specific type of gift or a specific item.<br/>
		<br/>
		<b> “I am going to bring an apple pie,”</b> your friend tells you.Again,the indefinite article indicates that she is not talking about a specific apple pie.Your friend probably doesn’t even have any pie yet.The indefinite article only appears with singular nouns.Consider the following<i>examples of indefinite</i>articles used in contex.</p>

		<h2>Exceptions:Choosing A or An</h2>
		<p>There are a few exceptions to the general rule of using a before words that start with consonants and an before words that begin with vowels.The first letter of the word honor,<i>for example,</i> is a consonant, but it’s<i>unpronounced</i>.In spite of its spelling, the word honor begins with a vowel sound.<b>Therefore, we use an.Consider the example sentence below for an illustration of this concept</b>.</p>
